A program by Richard Cavell

Version 1.1 (1 April 2018)

This is a simple program written in standard C, dialect C89.  It reads
in the standard input, and prints the byte-for-byte reverse of it on the
standard output.  It can be used on any type of data. It is good for
reversing text input, as long as you are not using "wide characters".

The program should compile on anything. You can use GNU make to compile
simply by typing "make".

This program exists to demonstrate the algorithms used.  You are welcome to
study the source code and the algorithms.

My thanks to the wizards on the [c-prog] mailing list on Yahoo! Groups, and
kate from IRC, for their feedback.

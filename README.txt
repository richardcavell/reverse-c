Version 1.0 (24 March 2018)

This is a simple program written in standard C, dialect C89.

It reads in the standard input, and prints the reverse of it on the
standard output.

This program exists to demonstrate the algorithms used.  You are welcome to
study the source code and the algorithms.

My thanks to the wizards on the [c-prog] mailing list on Yahoo! Groups for
their feedback.

reverse-c (alternative version)
A program by Richard Cavell

(c) 2017-2025
Version 1.3 (30 May 2025)

This alternative version of reverse uses getchar() and putchar() instead of
fread() and fwrite().

The main version will probably run faster. However, you are welcome to study
this one as well, which I provide for that purpose.
